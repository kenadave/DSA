=> We create the source code. Compiler generates machine level binary code from it. The binary code is stored in RAM. 
=> RAM has 3 parts : Machine level code, Stack, and Heap.
=> Stack Memory is used to store functions and local variables.
=> Heap Memory is used to store object references.
=> Recursion function calls are stored in stack.
=> 2 types of Recursion : Head ( The call is done first and then rest of the statements. So for executing the last statment of the method, last/base call is required )
                          Tail ( The call is at the end of executing all the statements. )
